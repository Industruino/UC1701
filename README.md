This library is used to control the onboard 128x64 LCD of Industruino. It allows you to display text and simple graphics with a minimum of overhead.

Please move this library into your Arduino libraries folder. 
Once you restart the Arduino IDE, a couple of example sketches should appear in "File->Examples->UC1701".


See README file in the libraries folder for some more info https://github.com/Industruino/libraries
